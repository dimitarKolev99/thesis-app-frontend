            <h5>What is LocalAPI?</h5>
            <div>
              Local API is a service from Liebherr that allows you to get access
              to your appliance's data. Liebherr offers SmartModule connects
              refrigerators and freezers in a network with Liebherr
              SmartMonitoring and allows you to use its extensive digital
              monitoring and documentation functions. In addition, appliances
              can be integrated into a customerâ€™s existing monitoring system via
              a local API. The small electronic unit with integrated LAN/WiFi is
              ready to use as soon as it is mounted on the back of the appliance

            <h5>What is an appliance?</h5>
            <div>
              Liebherr appliances safely store highly-sensitive medicines with
              precise electronics and temperature monitoring systems for
              hospitals, laboratories and medi cal research facilities.

            <h5>What is a serial number?</h5>
            <div>
              A serial number is a unique, individualized, and alphanumeric
              identifier assigned to a specific item or product by its
              manufacturer, organization, or governing body. This identification
              code serves as a means of distinguishing one item from others of
              the same type, allowing for easy tracking, documentation, and
              authentication. Serial numbers are commonly found on a wide range
              of items, including electronic devices, automobiles, machinery,
              appliances, currency, and various consumer products. They play a
              crucial role in supply chain management, warranty tracking,
              inventory control, product recalls, and anti-counterfeiting
              measures. Typically, a serial number consists of a combination of
              letters, numbers, and sometimes special characters. The format and
              length of the serial number can vary depending on the industry and
              the specific purpose for which it is used. Since each serial
              number is unique, it provides a reliable method for identifying
              individual items throughout their lifecycle, from production to
              disposal or ownership transfer.
