        Official LocalAPI Licensing Portal
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is the official portal for generating and obtaining access to the
        localAPI service by Liebherr. You can receive your license file here to
        enable the localAPI. SmartModule connects refrigerators and freezers in
        a network with Liebherr SmartMonitoring and allows you to use its
        extensive digital monitoring and documentation functions. In addition,
        appliances can be integrated into a customerâ€™s existing monitoring
        system via a local API. The small electronic unit with integrated
        LAN/WiFi is ready to use as soon as it is mounted on the back of the
        appliance.
